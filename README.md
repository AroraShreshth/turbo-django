# Turbo for Django

This repository aims to help you integrate [Hotwire Turbo](https://turbo.hotwire.dev/) with Django. Inspiration might be taken from [@hotwired/turbo-rails](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-rails).

We are still in the early stage of this project so don't expect anything remotely production grade for a while.

Discussions about a Django/Hotwire integration are happening on the [Hotwire forum](https://discuss.hotwire.dev/t/django-backend-support-for-hotwire/1570).

## Experiments

As we are several to experiment on the integration, I suggest we all dump our code in a sub-directory of `experiments/` so we can all benefit from the ideas of others. Those experiments can be cleaned-up and made reusable later in the `src/` directory.
